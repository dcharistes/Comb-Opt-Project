# Combinatorial Optimizatio Project
The Generalized Vehicle Routing problem investigated in this project is the Single Commodity Formulation [[1]](#1). This is a study on model optimization for this problem proposing a custom Branch and Cut algorithm, as well as heuristics. The final architecture of the custom Branch and Cut algorithm (Task3) is then compared to the simple Branch and Bound algorithm (Task2) and the state-of-the-art Gurobi solver (Task1) for a computational analysis on execution time and nodes traversed in increasing problem order.
